                     Erlang Quest WEB SCOREBOARD

HOW TO BUILD
------------

Go to the lib/quest_webboard/ directory and run

   make compile

Dependencies of note:

- One indirect dependency is the C header file "uuid.h", which on
  Ubuntu (and Debian?) is provided by the package "libossp-uuid-dev".

HOW TO START
------------

Go to the lib/quest_webboard/ directory and run

   make run

This starts up Erlang Quest, the web scoreboard, and an Erlang
interactive shell.

The web board runs on port 8000 as default.

Note: if you want to connect to Erlang Quest remotely, run like this

   MY_IP=... make run
      

HOW TO USE
----------

Point a web browser at http://localhost:8000/ .
The scoreboard is updated dynamically.
